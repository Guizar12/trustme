iOS TrustMe
===========

An extreme method of disabling most certificate verification checks on iOS applications.
TrustMe will defeat certificate pinning in most cases. 

Description
-----------

Requires a jailbroken device. This "Tweak" disables the SecTrustEvaluate. It should
only be used on testing devices with no personal data or information, since this 
will completely disable most SSL safeguards. 

Requirements
------------
MobileSubstrate (Should come with jailbroken devices)
dpkg (Install from Cydia)
